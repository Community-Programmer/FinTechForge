✨ Recent Searches Feature Implementation

  📝 Description

  Added comprehensive Recent Searches functionality throughout the FinTechForge application. Users can now see and quickly access their previous search queries for both stocks and news. The feature stores up to 10 most recent searches per category in localStorage, providing convenient access to previously searched items. Users can click on any recent search to quickly repeat it, remove individual searches, or clear the entire search history for that category.
